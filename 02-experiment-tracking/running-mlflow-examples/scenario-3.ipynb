    "## Steps\n",
    "### Virtual Machine as The Tracking Server\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create a firewall rule\n",
    "```gcloud_command\n",
    "    gcloud compute firewall-rules create mlflow-tracking-server \\\n",
    "        --network default \\\n",
    "        --priority 1000 \\\n",
    "        --direction ingress \\\n",
    "        --action allow \\\n",
    "        --target-tags mlflow-tracking-server-tag \\\n",
    "        --source-ranges 0.0.0.0/0 \\\n",
    "        --rules tcp:5000 \\\n",
    "        --enable-logging\n",
    "```\n",
    "##### Understanding the code:\n",
    "1. `gcloud compute firewall-rules create mlflow-tracking-server`  \n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Creates a new firewall rule in GCP.\n",
    "    - **mlflow-tracking-server:** The name of the firewall rule. You can choose any name, but it should be descriptive.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `--network default`  \n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Specifies the network to which this firewall rule applies.\n",
    "    - **default:** Refers to the default VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) network in your GCP project. If you're using a custom network, replace default with the name of your network.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `--priority 1000`  \n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Sets the priority of the firewall rule.\n",
    "    - **1000:** The priority value. Lower numbers indicate higher priority. GCP evaluates firewall rules in order of priority, so a rule with priority 1000 will be evaluated before a rule with priority 2000.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note: If multiple rules match the same traffic, the rule with the lowest priority number takes precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `--direction ingress`  \n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Specifies the direction of traffic to which the rule applies.\n",
    "    - **ingress:** This rule applies to incoming traffic (traffic coming into your VM). For outgoing traffic, you would use egress.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `--action allow`  \n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Specifies the action to take when traffic matches this rule.\n",
    "    - **allow:** Allows traffic that matches the rule. You could also use deny to block traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `--target-tags mlflow-tracking-server`  \n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Applies the firewall rule to specific VM instances.\n",
    "    - **mlflow-tracking-server-tag:** A network tag that you assign to the VM(s) running the MLflow Tracking Server. Only VMs with this tag will be affected by this firewall rule.  \n",
    "    **How to Assign Tags:**\n",
    "    When creating a VM, you can add the tag **mlflow-tracking-server-tag** in the Networking section.\n",
    "    For an existing VM, go to the VM's details page, click Edit, and add the tag under Network tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `--source-ranges 0.0.0.0/0`  \n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Specifies the source IP ranges for the traffic.\n",
    "    - **0.0.0.0/0:** Allows traffic from any IP address (i.e., the entire internet). This is useful for public-facing services but can be a security risk. For better security, restrict this to specific IP ranges (e.g., your office IP or VPN IP).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `--rules tcp:5000`  \n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Specifies the protocol and port to which the rule applies.\n",
    "    - **tcp:5000:** Allows TCP traffic on port 5000. This is the default port for the MLflow Tracking Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `--enable-logging`  \n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Enables logging for this firewall rule.\n",
    "    - **What It Does:** \n",
    "        - Logs all traffic that matches this rule to Cloud Logging.\n",
    "        - Useful for monitoring and debugging traffic to your MLflow Tracking Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Where to View Logs:**\n",
    "    Go to Logging > Logs Explorer in the Google Cloud Console and filter by the firewall rule name (mlflow-tracking-server).\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Note:** enabling logging will increase cost\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What Does This Firewall Rule Do?\n",
    "- Allows incoming TCP traffic on port 5000 to any VM in the default network that has the tag mlflow-tracking-server.\n",
    "- Source: Any IP address (0.0.0.0/0).\n",
    "- Action: Allows the traffic.\n",
    "- Logging: Logs all allowed traffic for monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Use Case\n",
    "If you have a VM running the MLflow Tracking Server:\n",
    "- Assign the tag mlflow-tracking-server-tag to the VM.\n",
    "- This firewall rule will allow external users to access the MLflow UI and API at http://<VM_PUBLIC_IP>:5000.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Security Considerations\n",
    "- **Restrict Source IPs:** Instead of 0.0.0.0/0, specify a smaller range of trusted IPs (e.g., your office IP or VPN IP).\n",
    "- **Use HTTPS:** If exposing the server to the internet, use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) with SSL/TLS to encrypt traffic.\n",
    "- **Authentication:** Add authentication to the MLflow Tracking Server to prevent unauthorized access.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to Delete the Firewall Rule\n",
    "If you no longer need the rule, you can delete it with:  \n",
    "`gcloud compute firewall-rules delete mlflow-tracking-server`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create a virtual instance as the tracking server\n",
    "```gcloud_command\n",
    "    gcloud compute instances create mlflow-tracking-server \\\n",
    "        --project=terraform-demo-project-412717 \\\n",

    "\n",
    "7. `--provisioning-model=STANDARD`\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Specifies the provisioning model for the VM.\n",
    "- **STANDARD:** The VM is provisioned with guaranteed resources. The alternative is SPOT, which uses preemptible VMs at a lower cost but with the risk of termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `--service-account=<PROJECT_NUMBER>-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Assigns a service account to the VM.\n",

    "\n",
    "10. `--tags=mlflow-tracking-server-tag`\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Assigns network tags to the VM.\n",
    "- **mlflow-tracking-server-tag:** A tag that can be used to apply firewall rules or route traffic. For example, you can create a firewall rule that allows traffic only to VMs with this tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. `--create-disk=auto-delete=yes,boot=yes,device-name=mlflow-tracking-server,image=projects/ubuntu-os-cloud/global/images/ubuntu-2004-focal-v20220610,mode=rw,size=10,type=projects/<PROJECT_ID>/zones/europe-west1-b/diskTypes/pd-balanced`\n",
